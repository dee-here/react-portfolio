          I am a web developer with an interest in developing meaningful user
          experiences. My approach to web development is rooted in
          collaboration. I enjoy working closely with designers, UX, and end
          users.

          Outside of work, I enjoy staying active and being in nature. Fostering
          dogs during the pandemic was one of my most rewarding experiences.
